            type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
            but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
            essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with 
            the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus 
            PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Lorem Ipsum is
